* What is namespace?

    A namespace is a system that has a unique name for each and every object in Python. An object might be a variable or a method. Python itself maintains a namespace in the form of a Python dictionary.


* Scope:

    # Local scope:

        When a variable/function is created inside a function, it is only accessible within the function i.e locally. 

    # Global:

        When a variable is defined outside the function, it is accessible anywhere, i.e within any function or outside of it and hence the variable has a global scope.
