        Slicing
        You can also pull a segment of a list (for instance, the first three entries or the last two entries). This is called slicing. For instance:

        to pull the first x entries, you use [:x], and
        to pull the last y entries, you use [-y:].

    # Removing items
        
        Remove an item from a list with .remove(), and put the item you would like to remove in parentheses.

    # Adding items

        Add an item to a list with .append(), and put the item you would like to add in parentheses.
