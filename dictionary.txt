* Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

    A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
    Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values.

    i.e it has "Key" : "Value" pairs.

    The "Key" can also be used to access individual elements. 

* How to create a dictionary:


    programming_dictionary = {
        "Bug" : "An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected.",
        "Function" : "A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.",
    }


* How to add something to dictionary:


    programming_dictionary["Loop"] = "The action of doing something over and over again."


* Retrieving items from a dictionary:


    print(programming_dictionary["Loop"])


* empty_dictionary = {}


* How to edit a dictionary:


    programming_dictionary["Bug"] = "A moth in your computer"

    {Basically we are using the syntax to add a new item, and here it detects the keyword and replace's the previous value with a new value.}


* for loop & dictionary:


    for key in programming_dictionary:
        print(key)


    {The above syntax will display the key words, to get the values, we need to use the key words;}

    for key in programming_dictionary:
        print(programming_dictionary[key])
        
    for (key, value) in dict.items():
        print(key)
        print(value)


* Dictionary comprehension:

    new_dict = {new_key: new_value for item in list}
    
    Eg:
    name = ["Vict", "Max", "Clemence", "Juventus", "Jane"]
    
    new_dict = {student: random.randint(0, 101) for student in name}

   
    new_dict = {new_key : new_value for (key, value) in dict.items()}
    
    or with conditions:
    
    new_dict = {new_key : new_value for (key, value) in dict.items() if test}
    eg:
    
    passed_students = {student:score for (student, score) in new_dict.items() if score > 60}
