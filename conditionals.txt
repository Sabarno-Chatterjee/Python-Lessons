*Ternary Operator in Python:

    Ternary operators are also known as conditional expressions are operators that evaluate something based on a condition being true or false.
    It simply allows testing a condition in a single line replacing the multiline if-else making the code compact.

    Syntax : 

    [on_true] if [expression] else [on_false] 

    e.g:

    num = "even" if (num % 2 == 0) else "odd"
    print(num)
