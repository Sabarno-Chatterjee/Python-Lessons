Python Functions.

    A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

    You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

    A function can return data as a result.

    Eg:

    def greet():
        print("Hello")

    #Calling a function:

    greet()


    Arguments:

    Information can be passed into functions as arguments.

    Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.

    eg:

    def greetings(name):

        print(f"Hello {name}")

    
    #Calling:

    greetings(input("Please enter your name."))

    {Here the function greetings is asking the user for their name and passing the argument to the parameter name.}


    Positional arguments:

    def greetwith(name, location):

      print(f"hello {name}, isn't the weather in {location} splendid today?")
    
    # Calling:


    user_name = input("Please enter your name.")
    user_location = input("Please enter your location.")

    greetwith(user_name, user_location)

    {Here the function works perfectly fine unless we interchange the arguments i. [greetwith(user_location, user_name)], doing so will return an output with name instead of location and vice versa.}



    Keyword arguments:


    def greetwith(name, location):

        print(f"hello {name}, isn't the weather in {location} splendid today?")

    #Calling:
    
    user_name = input("name?")
    user_location = input("location?")

    greetwith(location = user_location, name = user_name)

    {Here how we position our arguments while calling the function doesn't matter as we have used keyword arguments. }
